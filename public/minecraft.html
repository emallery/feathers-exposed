    <h1>Hewwo! ðŸª¶ðŸŽµ</h1>
    <p>This guide will help you install the <i>Dragon Survival</i> mod needed to
      play on my minecwaf server :3</p>

    <img src="img/dragon1.png">

    <p>If you already know what you're doing, then feel free to follow the
      instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/DragonSurvivalTeam/DragonSurvival/wiki/">
        Dragon Survival Wiki</a>. <b>Check my <a href="#mod-list">mod list</a> to
        make sure you get the right versions of everything.</b>

    <h1>Installation</h1>

    <p>
      First of all, I <strong>highly</strong> recommend using
      <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism Launcher</a> as an alternative to
      the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download">default Minecraft launcher</a>
      for managing mods. Among other features, Prism Launcher makes it
      significantly easier to install, update, and downgrade mods, and can keep
      your modded instances completely separate from your vanilla one, so you
      don't risk corrupting your regular save files.
      <br>
      <i>Not that corrupting your worlds with dragons would be the wooorst thing
        ever.. >:)</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      In terms of security, Prism Launcher is open-source, and, i mean,
      <a href="https://github.com/orgs/PrismLauncher/discussions/3861">they say
        they're not a virus</a>, so like, that's good. You will need to log into
      it, but you can revoke the app's access to your Minecraft account at any
      time under the "App Access" area <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/app-access">here</a>.
      You can read more about the launcher on their
      <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/overview/faq/">FAQ</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Prism Launcher</h2>

    <p>
      Download the latest version of <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism
        Launcher</a> and install it. When you open it for the first time, you
      should see a window prompting you to choose your language, then to sign into
      your Microsoft account.
    </p>

    <img src="img/prism1.png">

    <p>
      Once you've signed in, you should see a window that looks something like
      this. Click on "Add Instance" in the top left.
    </p>

    <img src="img/prism2.png">

    <p>
      You should see something like this. If you just want to play regular
      Minecraft, then you're done! But you wanna play with <i>dragons</i>, right??
    </p>

    <p>
      On this screen, make sure to:
    <ul>
      <li>Give it a <b>descriptive name</b>.</li>
      <li>Set the <b>Minecraft version</b> to <code>1.21.1</code>.</li>
      <li>Check the <b>NeoForge Mod Loader</b> option near the bottom right, and choose the <b>latest</b> version
        (<code>21.1.212</code> at the time of writing).</li>
    </ul>
    Then click "OK".
    </p>

    <img src="img/prism3.png">

    <p>You should see your new instance. Right click on it, and select <b>Edit...</b></p>

    <img src="img/prism4.png" class="fake-shadow">

    <p>Click on <b>mods</b>, then click on <b>Download mods</b>.</p>

    <img src="img/prism5.png">

    <p>Click on <b>CurseForge</b>, then search for <code>Dragon Survival</code>.
      Find the mod just called "Dragon Survival", by BlackAuresArt. <i>You might
        have to scroll down to find it.</i> It's the one with this cool dragon art!
    </p>

    <p>Select version <code>DragonSurvival-1.21.1-v2.0.37-21.10.2025-all.jar</code>,
      then click on <b>Select mod for download</b>.
    </p>

    <img src="img/prism6.png">

    <p>
      Now search for <code>GeckoLib</code>, select it, and choose the <b>latest
        version</b> (<code>geckolib-neoforge-1.21.1-4.8.2.jar</code> at the time
      of writing). Click on <b>Select mod for download</b>.
    </p>

    <img src="img/prism7.png">

    <p>
      That's all that's required to play on the server! But you can
      install extra mods if you want, as long as they're compatible with the dragon stuff.
      See the next section for some recommendations.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you're done adding mods, click <b>Review and confirm</b> at the very bottom.
      Make sure you have everything you want, then click <b>OK</b>.
    </p>

    <img src="img/prism8.png">

    <p>
      Close out of the windows until you're back to the main menu, then double-click
      on your <i>Dragon Survival</i> instance to launch the game!
    </p>

    <p>
      The game will take a few minutes to launch the first time, as it's downloading
      everything.
    </p>

    <img src="img/prism9.png">

    <p>
      You're done! Click <b>Multiplayer</b> and connect to the server with the
      connection info I've given you! The server uses a whitelist, so make sure
      I have your username. You can check it in the top-right corner of the
      Prism Launcher window.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mod-list">Complete Mod List</h2>

    <p>
      Here are some additional mods that I recommend downloading. They can be
      obtained the same way as the others, in the "Mods" section of your instance's
      console window. Screenshot is for reference, see the actual version numbers
      in the table below.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're here because I linked you from the top of the page, also make sure
      you're running Minecraft <b>1.21.1</b> and have these versions of <b>Dragon
        Survival</b> and <b>GeckoLib</b>.

    <p>
      <b>Note about Distant Horizons:</b> for whatever reason, the latest (as of writing) version
      has some kind of bug where it sometimes crashes on launch with an error like this.
      IDK what causes it, but restarting the game a few times fixes it. Hopefully the
      mod updates to fix it, because I really really recommend it, even if you have
      to put up with some jank like this:
    </p>

    <h2>Shaders</h2>

    <p>
      Shaders are graphical mods that completely change how the game is rendered,
      often adding stuff like realtime lighting, shadows, and other eye candy.
      Prism Launcher can manage shaders for you, or you can install them manually
      by searching the web for "Minecraft shaders" and following their installation
      instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>You must have the <code>Sodium</code> and <code>Iris</code> mods
        installed in order to use shaders!!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Click on <b>Shader packs</b> on the left, then <b>Download shaders</b> on
      the right.
    </p>

    <img src="img/shaders1.png">

    <p>
      Search for whatever you like, and download whatever you want. Shaders have
      their own compatibilty quirks, but generally work with most mods. If you're
      using <code>Distant Horizons</code>, make sure your shader is on this
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/Steveplays28/52db568f297ded527da56dbe6deeec0e">
        compatibility list
      </a> (or otherwise indicates that it is compatible with DH).<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      My go-to shader pack is <code>BSL Shaders</code>. I find it has a good balance
      between performance and quality, and it looks nice without looking too drastically different
      from the vanilla Minecraft vibe. It also supports Distant Horizons.
    </p>

    <p>
      Select your shader, then click <b>Select shader pack for download</b>,
      then click <b>Review and confirm</b>. You will see a confirmation window
      similar to the one for installing mods. Click <b>OK</b>.
    </p>

    <img src="img/shaders2.png">

    <h2 id="update-mods">Updating Mods</h2>

    <p>
      To update your mods, right click on your Dragon Survival instance and select
      <b>Edit...</b>.
    </p>

    <img src="img/prism4.png" class="fake-shadow">

    <p>
      Then click on <b>Check for Updates</b> on the right.
    </p>

    <img src="img/update1.png">

    <p>
      You should see a window showing all available mod updates. The launcher
      usually does a good job of making sure that the new updates will be
      compatible, with everything else but it's good to double-check what it's
      doing before clicking OK.
    </p>
